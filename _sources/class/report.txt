Report Checklist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [ ] Is the report written in LaTeX or MSWord using the 2 column ACM template?
* [ ] Is the report spell checked?
* [ ] Are you using **a** and **the** properly?
* [ ] Are you using build in numbered section management?

  * MSWord has Sections that must be used
  * RST uses underlines. Make sure the TOC is numbered
  * LaTeX has \section. \subsection, and so on

* [ ] Are you using real bulleted lists in Word and not just a "*" or a "-"?
* [ ] Have you carelessly pasted and copied into the document without using
  proper formats. E.g. in MSWord this is a problem.
* [ ] Have you plagiarized?
* [ ] Have you checked in the report as PDF in the docs/report folder
* [ ] Have you checked in the sources (word, or latex) in the docs/report folder
* [ ] Have you checked in the original images in docs/report/images

Tips
^^^^

* leverage parallel editing:

  * MS onedrive (recommended): allows you to edit a word document in collaboration
  * Google Drive: google drive could be used to collaborate on text that is than
    pasted into document
  * Github: allows you to collaborate on latex documents with coordination

* The final document will not accept as google document. You must use the 2
  column ACM template. We observed that students that use google docs
  underestimate the lack of structural document features and lack of 2 column format. Formats
  written in google docs are typically of lower quality.
  The acm template gives you guidance how to write a paper
  properly. Including references.
