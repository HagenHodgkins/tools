ACM Template
============

In order to produce uniform length reports and avoid differences
beween reports provided we are using the ACM templates that can be
found for Word and LaTeX here:

* Word: https://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/pubform.doc
* LaTeX: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template 
* PDF sample: https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/article-templates/sig-alternate-sample.pdf

We are not accepting any other formats and if done so the report will
be returned without review.
